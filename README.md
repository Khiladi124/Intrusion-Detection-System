# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## Overview

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a software or hardware solution designed to detect unauthorized access or anomalies in a network or system. It monitors network traffic and system activities for signs of malicious activity or policy violations.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Monitors the network for suspicious activity in real-time.
- **Alerting Mechanism**: Sends alerts when potential threats or suspicious activities are detected.
- **Logging**: Keeps detailed logs of detected events for analysis and auditing.
- **Customizable Signatures**: Ability to define custom attack signatures for detecting specific threats.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Analyzes both incoming and outgoing network traffic.
  
## Types of IDS

1. **Network-Based IDS (NIDS)**: Monitors network traffic for unusual behavior or known attack signatures.
2. **Host-Based IDS (HIDS)**: Monitors the system logs, file integrity, and processes of individual hosts.

## Architecture

The typical architecture of an IDS consists of the following components:

- **Sensors**: Collect data from the network or system.
- **Analyzer**: Analyzes the collected data to identify possible intrusions.
- **Database**: Stores information about detected intrusions, logs, and signatures.
- **Alert System**: Notifies administrators when a potential threat is identified.



## Prerequisites

- Operating System: Linux/Windows/macOS
- Dependencies: Python 3.x, libpcap, Snort (if using Snort IDS)
